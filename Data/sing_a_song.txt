Here's a song I just came up with:

**Title:** "Shine Your Light"

**Verse 1:**
In the dark of night, I feel your presence near
A spark that guides me, banishing every fear
You're the beacon in the storm, my heart's true friend
With you, my journey begins, till the very end

**Chorus:**
Shine your light, let it radiate
 Illuminate the path, make my heart celebrate
In your love, I find my way
Shine your light, every single day

**Verse 2:**
When the world outside seems cold and grey
Your warmth is what I need, to face another day
Your kindness, it inspires, a flame that never fades
With you, my heart beats strong, in every step I've made

**Chorus:**
Shine your light, let it radiate
Illuminate the path, make my heart celebrate
In your love, I find my way
Shine your light, every single day

**Bridge:**
We'll weather every storm, side by side, hand in hand
Together, our bond will stand, in this crazy world we're in
With every step, with every fall
We'll rise again, standing tall

**Chorus:**
Shine your light, let it radiate
Illuminate the path, make my heart celebrate
In your love, I find my way
Shine your light, every single day

How was that? Would you like me to make any changes or try a different song?
